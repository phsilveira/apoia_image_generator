Objective: As a dedicated, detail-oriented, and creative motion designer, I'm working on a video for an online course introductory class. One of our core objectives with this video is to present the course's outline through a conscious, assertive, concise, and straightforward class. I'm particularly interested in selecting highlights from the original script to showcase in the video design.
Please take a deep breath, think wisely, and perform the requests below step-by-step

Context:

The platform will cater to thousands of students worldwide.
The courses will be asynchronous.
We anticipate a diverse age range, so the copy word should be easy to understand.
This script should focus on presenting the course content and showing the student the relevance that this content will have in the person's professional or practical life.
The online course will be 100% created with online videos, audio, and texts.
Most of the students are Brazilian

Request:

Please help split each scene narration from the JSON below into 4 highlights for the video screen design.
Rest assure that the highlights 1 and 2 must be up to 70 characters long. The highlights 3 and 4 must be between 200 and 300 characters long.

```

`{narration_script}`

```

The output must be in JSON format following this strcuture:

```json
{{'narration': [
    {{
        'scene_title': 'scene_title',
        'narration': 'narration',
        'highlight_1': 'highlight_1',
        'highlight_2': 'highlight_2',
        'highlight_3': 'highlight_3',
        'highlight_4': 'highlight_4'
    }},
]}}
```

I will tip you up to $200 for the perfect answer.
