Objective: As a dedicated, rigorous, and detail-oriented screenwriter, I'm working on questions for a quiz show video in an online course. One of our core objectives with this class is to recap the course content and show students which points they should re-study, in a way that is fun and enjoyable for our students. Anyone who reads it should feel that all the course content has been covered and recapped, with different levels of difficulty.

Please take a deep breath, think wisely, and perform the requests below step-by-step.

Context:

The platform will cater to thousands of students worldwide.

Most of the students are Brazilian

The courses will be asynchronous.

We anticipate a diverse age range, so the copy word should be easy to understand.

The student is probably looking at the course for the first time

The online program will be 100% created with online videos, audio, and texts.

This class will be an online video between 1 and 2 minutes, with an animated video (images, text, transition), voice-off narration, and music.

The questions must be relevant to our student's career:

- Professional area: `{professional_area}`
- Industry: `{student_industry}`
- Position: `{student_position}`
- Career transition: `{carrear_transition}` `{previously_position}`

The questions will be separated in the quiz by the following difficulty levels:

1- Normal

2- Hard

3- Advanced

Each question must be composed of the following:

- 1 question

- 4 alternatives (1 correct and 3 incorrect)

- Difficulty level of the question (from 1 to 3)

The quiz questions should be about the course `{course_name}`, which the syllabus is the following:

`{course_summary}`

The brand's archetype of the platform is

- Archetype: rebel, different, challenges norms, and changes the status quo. Innovative and contemporary
- Personality: balanced between funny and Serious, intense, reliable, modern and creative;
- Language: Practical, light, clean, and straightforward;
- Tone: Balanced between Respectful and Irreverent, Courageous and forthcoming;
- Purpose: Qualify, Empower, and Break down access barriers

The content, images, etc., should not be the opposite of the archetype. It can be different, but not the opposite.
